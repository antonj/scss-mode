* SCSS Mode for Emacs
  Major mode for editing [[http://sass-lang.com/][SCSS]] files in Emacs.
  
**  Features
  - Compilation of current file on save. (Disable by changing
    =scss-compile-at-save= to =nil=)
  - Flymake support, enable with =M-x flymake-mode=
  - Indentation and highlighting (Derived from CSS-mode)
  - Syntax highlighting for variables and inline comments.

** Installation
   Command line utility sass is required, [[http://sass-lang.com/]]. Make
   sure sass location is in emacs PATH, example:
   
   : (setq exec-path (cons (expand-file-name "~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin") exec-path))
   
   Or customize =scss-sass-command= to point directly to your sass
   executable.

   Add something like this to your emacs load file:

   : (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/folder-where-you-put-scss-mode-el"))
   : (require 'scss-mode)
   : (add-hook 'scss-mode-hook 'auto-complete-mode) ;; optional but reccomended
   : (add-hook 'scss-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode)      ;; optional but reccomended
    
** Tips
   If you want to automatically hide the compilation buffer for every
   successful compilation have a look at [[https://github.com/antonj/.emacs.d/blob/master/aj-compilation.el][aj-compilation.el]]

   All successful compilations in other modes are also hidden, except
   for rgrep "compilations" where a successful compilation is what you
   are interested in...
